# Predicting-IPL-Match-Outcomes
The Indian Premier League (IPL) has become a
focal point for sports analytics due to its global popularity and
dynamic nature. This paper explores machine learning models to
predict match outcomes based on historical data. By analyzing
features such as team performance, venue, and toss results, the
study reveals key patterns influencing match results. Random
Forest, HistGradientBoosting, and SVM models were employed,
with the highest accuracy reaching 57.07%. The findings offer
insights for fans, analysts, and teams, while also highlighting the
complexity of cricket prediction.
